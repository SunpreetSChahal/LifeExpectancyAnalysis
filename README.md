# Life Expectancy Analysis

Within the notebook I analysed various datasets regarding international life expectancies throughout recent history.
Aiming to analyse various factors leading to a lower/higher life exepectancy, for example: War, GDP per capita, total GDP, disease and more. 


Advancements made in comparison to previous notebooks: 
- Multi-graph visualistion.
- In-depth data contextualisation and story-telling improvements.
- Use of more libraries, not previously used.
- Improving general code, to be less wasteful, more efficient and compacted (compacted in terms of making more of my code fit in a single cell).
